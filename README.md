# Contract Value Object

Contract value object are designed for two purposes:
1. To create objects that act like values (in the same way that two ruby `Date` objects are the same if their year, month, and date are the same).
2. To guarantee can only be created with correct values. That means that no invalid value types should be able to exist.

The inspiration for the value object part is taken from [Martin Fowler's discussion of the matter](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html).
It's implemented on top of the [Contracts gem](http://egonschiele.github.io/contracts.ruby/) that allows us to define the accepted values for each attribute.

In other words it's much like this GIF:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'contract_value_object'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install contract_value_object

## Usage

There are two main methods that are exposed when constructing a Contract Value Object:
- `attributes` - allows you to define all of the attributes that you expect to be passed in
  - input: hash, where the keys are the names of the attributes and the keys are the contract that must be met
- `defaults` - allows you to define the default values that will be set if a value will not be passed in. All of these should explicitly `Optional` contracts in the attributes.
  - input: hash, where the keys are the attributes that should be default and the keys are the default values
  
Additionally, Contract value object expects that you can redefine the setters for the arguments.
These setters will still check their contracts. They do, however, give us two abilities:
1. Perform more complicated validations
2. Allow transformations of the original data.

Example usage:

```ruby
class Truck < ContractValueObject
  class Wheel < ContractValueObject
    attributes(
      size: Optional[Enum[:xs, :s, :m, :l, :xl]],
    )

    defaults(
      size: :m,
    )
  end

  attributes(
    wheels: ArrayOf[Wheel],
    color: Enum[:red, :white, :blue],
    model: String,
  )

  private

  def wheels=(wheels)
    # transform all the inputs into wheels
    if wheels.all? { |wheel| wheel.is_a?(Symbol) }
      wheels = wheels.map do |size|
        Wheel.new(size: size)
      end
    end

    # make sure that wheels behave rationally
    raise ArgumentError, 'All of the wheels should be the same size' if wheels.uniq(&:size).count != 1

    @wheels = wheels
  end
end

truck = Truck.new(
  wheels: [Truck::Wheel.new, Truck::Wheel.new, Truck::Wheel.new, Truck::Wheel.new],
  color: :red,
  model: 'Ford F150',
)
```

One final thing to note, is that contract value objects will present all of the errors to the user at once.
Suppose we construct an invalid truck:
```ruby
Truck.new(
  wheels: [:s, :m, :m, :l],
  model: :ford
)
```

We'll get back a full error that says:
```
ContractValueObject::DefinitionError: 
1. `color`: Missing attribute `color`.
        Expected: #<Contracts::Builtin::Enum:0x007fcdff85c148 @vals=[:red, :white, :blue]>
2. `wheels`: All of the wheels should be the same size
3. `model`: Attribute `model` does not conform to its contract.
        Expected: String
        Actual: Symbol (:ford)
```

## Development

Run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local mcontract_value_objectine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version:
1. `rake release`
