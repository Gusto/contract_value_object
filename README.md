# Contract Value Object

Validate that your objects have the right inputs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'contract_value_object'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install contract_value_object

## Usage

Example usage:

Contract value object are designed for two purposes:
1. To create objects that act like values (in the same way that two ruby `Date` objects are the same if their year, month, and date are the same)
2. That values can only be created with correct types.

```ruby
class Truck < ContractValueObject
  class Wheel < ContractValueObject
    attributes(
      size: Optional[Enum[:xs, :s, :m, :l, :xl]],
    )

    defaults(
      size: :m,
    )
  end

  attributes(
    wheels: ArrayOf[Wheel],
    color: Enum[:red, :white, :blue],
    model: String,
  )
end

Truck.new(
  wheels: [Truck::Wheel.new, Truck::Wheel.new, Truck::Wheel.new, Truck::Wheel.new],
  color: :red,
  model: 'Ford F150',
)
```
